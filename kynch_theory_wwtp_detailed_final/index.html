<p>Kynch Theory and Application to Wastewater Treatment Plants</p>
<p>1. Overview</p>
<p>Kynch theory, introduced by G.J. Kynch in 1952, describes the
sedimentation of concentrated suspensions such as activated sludge in
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The theory assumes that the
settling velocity of particles depends only on the local solids
concentration and not on time or location within the settling zone. It
is primarily applied to the zone-settling stage of clarifiers and
thickeners, where solids form a sludge blanket that settles as a
cohesive mass. Kynch theory forms the foundation of the solids flux
method, which is widely used in clarifier and thickener design, as well
as in operational assessments.</p>
<p>2. Core Equations</p>
<p>The solids continuity equation for one-dimensional vertical settling
is:</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \left( v_s(C) \cdot
C \right)}{\partial z} = 0$$</p>
<p>Where: C is the solids concentration (kg/m³ or g/L), t is time (s), z
is depth measured positively downward (m), and v_s(C) is the hindered
settling velocity (m/s) as a function of C. The term v_s(C)·C represents
the solids flux in kg/(m²·s). The first term in the equation represents
the local rate of change of solids concentration over time, while the
second term represents the net transport of solids due to settling.</p>
<p>The solids flux relationship is defined as:</p>
<p>$$J(C) = v_s(C) \cdot C$$</p>
<p>Here: J(C) is the solids flux in kg/(m²·s). This is the mass of
solids passing through a unit horizontal area per second. For activated
sludge systems, typical operating solids flux values range from 0.1 to
0.4 kg/(m²·s) under normal conditions, depending on sludge settleability
and concentration.</p>
<p>The velocity of a concentration front is given by:</p>
<p>\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{d \left( v_s(C) \cdot C \right)}{dC}</p>
<p>This equation represents the characteristic speed at which a
concentration front moves through the settling zone. It is the
derivative of the solids flux with respect to solids concentration,
describing how changes in concentration affect the movement of settling
fronts.</p>
<p>3. Settling Regimes in WWTP Clarifiers</p>
<p>In sedimentation tanks, four distinct settling regimes are commonly
observed:<br />
1. Discrete particle settling – individual particles settle without
interaction.<br />
2. Flocculent settling – particles collide and aggregate to form larger
flocs, increasing settling velocity.<br />
3. Zone (hindered) settling – particles form a blanket that settles as a
single mass at a velocity dependent on concentration.<br />
4. Compression settling – solids at the bottom compress under their own
weight, expelling water.<br />
Kynch theory applies specifically to the zone-settling regime, where the
interactions between particles dominate and hinder their settling.</p>
<p>4. Solids Flux Method for Design and Operation</p>
<p>The solids flux method uses the relationship between settling
velocity and concentration to determine clarifier capacity. It involves
calculating the solids flux for a range of concentrations and finding
the minimum value that limits performance. This minimum is known as the
limiting solids flux (J_lim):</p>
<p>J_{\text{lim}} = \min_{C} J(C)</p>
<p>Once J_lim is determined, the minimum required surface area of the
clarifier can be calculated:</p>
<p>A_{\text{min}} = \frac{Q \cdot C_0}{J_{\text{lim}}}</p>
<p>Where: A_min is in m², Q is the influent flow rate (m³/s), C_0 is the
influent solids concentration (kg/m³), and J_lim is in kg/(m²·s).
Additionally, the surface overflow rate (SOR) should be checked to
ensure it is less than the settling velocity at the operating
concentration:</p>
<p>\mathrm{SOR} = \frac{Q}{A} \;&lt;\;
v_s\!\left(C_{\text{oper}}\right)</p>
<p>5. Common Settling Velocity Models</p>
<p>Settling velocity functions are typically determined from batch
settling tests. Two common empirical models are:</p>
<p>v_s(C) = v_0 \cdot e^{-k \cdot C} \quad \text{(Vesilind model)}</p>
<p>Where: v_0 is the theoretical settling velocity at zero concentration
(m/h), and k is the hindered settling coefficient (m³/kg). Typical
values for activated sludge are v_0 = 5–15 m/h and k = 0.05–0.15
m³/kg.</p>
<p>v_s(C) = v_{\text{St}} \cdot e^{-r_h \cdot C} + v_{\text{floc}} \cdot
e^{-r_f \cdot C} \quad \text{(Tak\'acs model)}</p>
<p>This double-exponential model separates the contributions from
hindered settling and flocculent settling. Parameters are determined by
fitting experimental data.</p>
<p>6. Practical Steps in WWTP Application</p>
<p>1. Conduct a batch settling test on a representative sludge sample,
recording interface height over time.<br />
2. Convert height-time data to concentration-velocity data.<br />
3. Fit an appropriate settling velocity model to the data.<br />
4. Compute solids flux J(C) for a range of concentrations.<br />
5. Identify J_lim from the curve.<br />
6. Calculate A_min and check SOR for both average and peak flows.<br />
7. Adjust sludge return and wasting rates to maintain optimal blanket
depth.</p>
<p>7. Worked Example</p>
<p>Given: Q = 5,000 m³/d, C_0 = 3,000 mg/L = 3 kg/m³, and from tests
v_s(3) = 1.0 m/h = 24 m/d.<br />
Hydraulic check:</p>
<p>A \approx \frac{Q}{v_s(C_{\text{oper}})} = \frac{5000}{24} \approx
208 \ \text{m}^2</p>
<p>If J_lim = 0.12 kg/(m²·s), then:</p>
<p>A_{\text{min}} = \frac{Q \cdot C_0}{J_{\text{lim}}}</p>
<p>Substituting Q = 5000/86400 m³/s and C_0 = 3 kg/m³ yields
approximately 144 m².</p>
